# Project Name Tech Hot or Not

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  >> It is a small website to analyze the preferences of Developers about certain frameworks / technologies


## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  >> One can see if the user is interested in the current hot technologies or if he is
  >> lagging behind the hot stuff, maybe it gives the user some inspiration on what to checkout.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  >> A simple tool to show you if you are interested in the hot web tech stacks of nowadays or if you rather prefer technologies
  >> who don't get much of attention by the community. But maybe you'll get some inspiration from the ranking what to test on 
  >> your next project.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  >> Tech-Stack self analysis for developers, also shows whats hot out there and might be of interest.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  >> simple decision making between the frameworks / technologies, it is straight forward and for some also entertaining

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  >> 'awesome thing' - Guy Thomas

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  >> create a simple website that shows clickable options for every part of the Software (i.e. Language, Backend, Frontend, DB etc.)
  >> simple mongoDB that stores the clicks on the technologies
  >> server just needs to handle a static, two get and three post routes

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  >> "Through Tech Hot or Not I found out that I should try MongoDB instead of sticking to SQL everytime, also Elixir & Phoenix seems
  >> to get a lot of attention by the community, maybe I'll give it a try on my next project."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  >> Simply clone the repo, start the server and you can already start voting for your favorite technology!
